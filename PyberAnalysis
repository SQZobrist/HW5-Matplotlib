Urban Areas are the most active and profitable for Pyber, with Total Rides 
sharply falling off when transitioning to Suburban, then Rural areas.

(apparent because they have the lowest Average Fare).

The pie charts illustrate how the Urban fares are smaller on 
average and those fares are also being shared by more drivers.
